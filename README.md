### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: Exploring how modern philosophy might be different from the Ancient Greek Philosophy, from the aspects of writing language and the central theme.
+ This project is conducted by Mingze Xu

+ Project summary: __What is philosophy?__ <br>
This is a really abstract question, and for most of us, we might not be able to give a proper definition to it. The origin of the term 'philosophy' can be traced back to ancient Greece, around the 6th century BCE. Some people might argue that philosophy is a branch of knowledge that seeks to understand the world and our place in it. This argument is really convincing. <br>
In this __History of Philosophy__ project, particularly the dataset __philosophy_data__, 36 world reknowned philosophers from 13 different schools of philosophy and their thounsands of sentences are included. From the dataset, we would manipulate the data and might be able to explore the progress or the development of the subject Philosophy. <br>
More specifically in this project, after researching the history of philosophy and simply oberserving the data, I would focus on how philosophy might have evolved. I categorized these schools into three groups: <br>
-  Ancient Greek Philosophy:Stoicism, Aristotle, Plato <br>
-  19th and 20th Century Philosophy: Capitalism, Continental, Feminism, German Idealism, Phenomenology, Communism, Nietzsche <br>
- Modern Philosophy: Analytic, Rationalism, Empiricism <br>

Acient Greek Philosophy and Modern Philosophy are actualy on the two endpoints of this situation, so I will focus on these two groups. <br>
__Research question__:
The research question would be how modern philosophy is different from the Ancient Greek Philosophy, from the aspects of writing language and the central theme.<br>
__Hypothesis__:
Considering the time gap of almost 2700 years, I hypothesize that the writing language would be different because the way people talk and write are evolving. Also, the central themes were also shifted because the ideology and understanding of life are changing in an unpredictable speed.
